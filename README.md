# ‚òÄÔ∏è Helios

This is the main focus of the Rimrock dev lab!

We are developing a production-grade performance data collection system.  
This system will not only let teams understand what their dotnet applications are doing (at the code level) but also help teams improve their applications by automatically spotting well-known performance bottlenecks.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Active Work Progress (as of 8/23/2023)

The below work is geared towards an **ALPHA** release.

- [x] cli - The main user interface. Work includes support for future extensibility for additional commands
- [x] collection/analysis - This is the bulk of the current effort. It includes adding ETW profiling support for CPU, as well as CSV output of the collected stacks.
  - [x] Data Analyzers - just CPU for now
  - [x] Output Mechanism - just CSV for now
  - [x] End-to-End plumbing (Host, DI, Configuration, Logging)
  - [ ] Additional data streams (Memory allocations, Exceptions)
  - [ ] Additional data format,
    - [x] PerfView XML
    - [ ] Chromium (?)
    - [x] Speedscope
    - [ ] A binary (graph-like) data format

Several output format (and UI) is now supported including,

- CSV
- PerfView XML

`helios-cli` is also fully functional at the command line to both collect and analyze,

```PowerShell
.\helios-cli.exe collect --output-directory "{pwd}\Collections\{guid}" --duration "00:00:10" --symbol-store-cache "D:\symbols" --output-format "speedscope" --data-analyzer "CPU" --verbose
```
